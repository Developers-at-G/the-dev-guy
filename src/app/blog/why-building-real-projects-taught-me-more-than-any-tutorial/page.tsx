                  Suddenly, nothing is handed to you. You&apos;re the one deciding how things should work, where to fetch data, how to handle empty states, loading states, slow networks, form validation, weird bugs. You realize quickly: tutorials are helpful, but they don&apos;t prepare you for the real mess of real apps.

                  All those things? I only started learning them when I stopped watching and started building.

                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
                  When you&apos;re building your own app, you&apos;re not just copying code â€” you&apos;re making decisions. That&apos;s where the real growth happens. You search, test, refactor, hit bugs, fix them, hit new ones, and repeat.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
                  You don&apos;t just learn &quot;how to use React&quot; â€” you learn how to think like a developer.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
                  Working on real apps at my job pushed this even further.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
                  Sometimes I ship something, feel good about it â€” then get feedback that it doesn&apos;t work quite right. Or that I missed tiny design details I hadn&apos;t even noticed. I go back, fix it, and still get more notes.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
                  That feedback loop â€” build, test, break, improve â€” is where I&apos;ve learned the most. Not just about code, but about quality, precision, and thinking clearly.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
                  Sure, the feedback can be direct. Sometimes it stings. But I&apos;ve learned to treat it like a debugging tool for my own thinking. It keeps me sharp and helps me level up way faster than finishing a course ever did.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
                  If you&apos;re serious about improving as a developer, you have to build.

                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
                  Not tutorials. Not clone apps with all the answers given. Real projects â€” where you don&apos;t know everything upfront, and you have to figure things out as you go.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
                  That&apos;s where the growth is. That&apos;s where the learning sticks.
