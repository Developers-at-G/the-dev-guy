Text Animation Effects - Simple Explanation
=========================================

What These Animations Do:
------------------------
1. Typewriter Effect: Makes text appear like it's being typed out, character by character,
   with a blinking cursor at the end (like an old typewriter).
   - The text appears gradually from left to right
   - An orange cursor blinks at the end
   - Takes 3.5 seconds to complete typing

2. Code Text Effect: Makes text look like computer code
   - Uses a monospace font (like old computer terminals)
   - Shows text in bright green (like The Matrix movie)

How to Use:
-----------
- Add class="typewriter" to any element for the typing animation
- Add class="code-text" to any element for the code look
- You can use both together: class="typewriter code-text"

[Technical Implementation Below]
------------------------------

Current Implementation:
The Profile component uses CSS classes 'typewriter' and 'code-text' for text animations.

To implement the typewriter effect, you'll need to add these CSS styles to your stylesheet:

1. Basic Typewriter Effect
-------------------------
.typewriter {
  overflow: hidden;
  border-right: .15em solid orange; /* Cursor */
  white-space: nowrap;
  animation: 
    typing 3.5s steps(40, end),
    blink-caret .75s step-end infinite;
}

@keyframes typing {
  from { width: 0 }
  to { width: 100% }
}

@keyframes blink-caret {
  from, to { border-color: transparent }
  50% { border-color: orange }
}

2. Code Text Effect
------------------
.code-text {
  font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
  color: #00ff00; /* Matrix-style green color */
}

Note: 
- The typewriter effect works best with single-line text
- You may need to adjust animation timing and steps based on text length
- Consider adding a delay with 'animation-delay' for sequential animations
